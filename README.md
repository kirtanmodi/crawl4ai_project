# Crawl4AI Project - Web Crawling and Extraction Tool

## Overview

This project provides a structured environment for web crawling and data extraction using the Crawl4AI library. It offers a modular, scalable approach to automated browsing with customizable configurations and robust error handling.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Set up and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv crawler-env

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source crawler-env/bin/activate
```

4. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
```

5. Run the setup command to prepare the environment:

```bash
crawl4ai-setup
```

6. Verify the installation:

```bash
crawl4ai-doctor
```

## Basic Usage

The project includes a simple example crawler in `crawlers/basic_crawler.py`. This script demonstrates how to:

- Initialize a web crawler with visible browser window
- Perform a basic crawl of a website
- Extract and display the content in markdown format

To run the example:

```bash
python crawlers/basic_crawler.py
```

## Advanced Configuration

The Crawl4AI library supports a wide range of configuration options for customizing crawler behavior:

- Browser settings (headless mode, viewport size, user agent)
- Navigation timeouts and wait strategies
- Content extraction rules
- Rate limiting and politeness controls
- Error handling policies

These options can be customized by modifying the crawler initialization and run parameters.

## Error Handling

The example script includes basic error handling. For production use, consider implementing more robust error handling strategies:

- Retry mechanisms for intermittent failures
- Logging of successful and failed crawls
- Fall-back options when browser automation fails

## Extending the Project

To add new crawling capabilities:

1. Create a new script in the `crawlers/` directory
2. Implement your custom crawling logic using the Crawl4AI API
3. Add appropriate error handling and result processing
4. Store results in the `data/` directory for further analysis

## Notes on Web Scraping Ethics

When using this tool, please adhere to ethical scraping practices:

- Respect websites' robots.txt files
- Implement reasonable rate limiting
- Don't scrape personal or sensitive information
- Consider the load your crawling places on the target server
- Be transparent about your crawler's identity (user agent)
- Review terms of service for websites you crawl

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Browser not launching**: Verify Playwright installation with `playwright install`
- **Slow performance**: Adjust timeouts and consider using `headless=True` for production
- **Content not being extracted**: Check if the target site uses JavaScript rendering and ensure the crawler waits for content to load
- **Access denied errors**: Some sites block automated browsers; consider using stealth plugins or adjusting your crawling pattern
